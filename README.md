Instead of launching this idea on JS i have decided to launch in on TS

For the sake of my personal growth, i will be journaling the process and the success and failure of this project.

I am able to make use of the google geocode api to reverse an address from my latitude and longitude and it works. however as i need to get the lat and long from the nativagator in the browser first be fore it can use the values to call the google apI to get the address. i would have 2 use effect in my code. this is to ensure that i do not face an error if the API is called before getting the lat long

i m going to work on how to get the api to work on my post man app
the api is working on post man
